# Azure AZ-900 certification training

At this point (27/04/2025), I have learned:
> what cloud computing means.
> cloud computing and capex/opex.
> there is an extensive list of services provided by Microsoft Azure.
> there are paid and free services. The free services are divided into two groups: some are free for the first 12 months, and some are free always.
> always quit/delete my projects after testing them; otherwise, I may be surprised with an invoice if my free credits expire.
